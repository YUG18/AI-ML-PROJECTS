# 🤖 JAARVIS Chatbot – Voice Activated Assistant

Hey there! This is my personal voice assistant project — I named it **JAARVIS** (yeah, kinda like Iron Man’s Jarvis 😉).  
Built entirely in Python, it listens to my voice, understands basic commands, and speaks back with useful actions.

## 🧠 What JAARVIS Can Do

- 🎙️ Listens to your voice input using your microphone
- 📢 Talks back using text-to-speech (pyttsx3)
- 🌐 Searches Wikipedia and reads summaries
- 🔢 Calculates expressions from spoken math commands (like "what is five into seven")
- ⏰ Tells the current time
- 📺 Opens YouTube, Google, or other websites on command
- 🙋 Responds to casual greetings
- 🛑 Can quit with "exit" or "quit"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- `speech_recognition` – to convert voice to text
- `pyttsx3` – for offline text-to-speech
- `wikipedia` – for fetching summaries
- `webbrowser` – to open links
- `datetime` – to fetch and speak the current time
